# Creating your report

-   See how to use [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) to create your report.
-   Use the Table template we provide in the `report.tex`, to create the required tables.
-   You can paste your results within each of the tables.
-   To compile `report.tex` with the TeX Live (macOS or Linux-based OS) into a PDF file run:
    
        pdflatex report.tex
        pdflatex report.tex
    
    You might need to run `pdflatex` twice.
